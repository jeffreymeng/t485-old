Prequel Stuff
There are two ways to define what happened on your first date with Ariane.

Firstly, you can pick a pre-configured date from the Prequel Menu under Options. There are three types of pre-configured date: a hot date (ie a date that ended in sex; these are marked with an asterisk), an ordinary date that didn't end in sex, or a bad date (although only one of them is so bad that Ariane won't date you again). There is also a setting called "Did It All!!" which combines all of the possible events from the first game (unless otherwise specified, this is the setting used by this walkthrough).

Secondly, if you completed the first game you would have received a code representing the events of that date. If you click the Enter Custom button under Options, when you start the game you will be prompted to enter your code. The advantage of doing this is that you can have combinations of events that aren't possible with the pre-configured dates. This is the only way to access a particular Easter Egg, which is mentioned below.

Endings
There are a total of 25 endings, listed below in the same order that they will appear in the gallery. If an ending involves sex it has an asterisk.

Once you’ve unlocked all 25 endings, you will have the option to pick one of the girls for an epilogue from the Endings gallery.

Player notebook
Version 1.0 added a player notebook, which keeps track of the information that you’ve learned about each character. Where possible I’ve noted where you learn specific things in this format: [Ariane: major] (ie. you’ve learned what Ariane’s major at college was). However, it is not yet fully comprehensive.

Clues
The player notebook also has six clues that can be unlocked by various actions (listed below):
#1 - Requires one of the following Ariane endings: 'Rebecca and Ariane', 'Phone Sex', 'Blackout Fun', 'Safety Pullout', or 'Ice Cream' (NB. the latter is no longer an achievement in v1.0, but it still triggers this clue)
#2 - You must learn that Rachel has a LAN party scheduled for that evening, visit the fortune teller at the carnival, and get the 'Concert and After Party' ending.
#3 - You must get any of the Bonnie endings, and be ditched by Arch Angel at the strip club (ie. instead of choosing "I don't care if you take me to headquarters." in the walkthrough below, choose "OK, OK, He is in that building ahead.").
#4 - You must get either of the Veronica endings, plus the 'Skinny Dipping at Night' Rachel ending.
#5 - You must get the two house party endings, 'House Party' and 'House Party With Rachel'.
#6 - You must get the 'Tequila Shots' and 'Concert and After Party' endings.

The Walkthrough
Any option with an asterisk next to it is a cosmetic choice. You will get a slightly different response if you choose another option but it won't significantly affect anything. A blank line is generally used to separate different paths.

The Beginning

To begin with only the first three options will be available. Once you've completed the different stories, the fourth option will become available.

Call Ariane, and see if she wants to go out again (go to Ariane)
Go to the local gym, where all the hot women tend to be on Saturday morning (go to The Gym)
Go back to sleep (go to Veronica & Bonnie)
Hang out at home and play some online games (go to Paula)

The Gym

OR
Talk to Rebecca [Rebecca: gym, dance]

It doesn't matter who you try to approach as you will be shot down one way or another. You will end up talking to Dave, who will suggest going to a bar to pick up chicks this evening.

What are you doing now?*
[Play with the settings until you get everything right]
[Ending: Something's In The Air]

Rachel

Do you come here often? (This leads to the end of the evening unless you went to the diner on your first date with Ariane, but still had a good date (which is not possible with the pre-configured dates, but a custom first date experience of 414aa should work). If that’s the case you will go to the diner again. This happens any time a date with Ariane or Rachel ends prematurely in the evening. Go to Diner)

Hello.
So, I'm supposed to distract you while my friend hits on your friend. [Rachel: honesty, name, student]
So, What is your major?
I have heard worse reasons for choosing a major.
We can wait, what is the wait like?*

I'll take the soup*
Cola* [Rachel: vegetarian, age]
No, It just sounded tasty.*
I like it here, I just don't know many people here yet. OR I love this town, there is so much to do here [Rachel: dishonest]

(You can learn a lot of information about Rachel during this conversation. However, most of the paths are mutually exclusive or do not lead to the date continuing, so you should save here if you’re being a completist. The numbers in brackets refer to how much that option improves the PC's relationship with Rachel.)
