                    <p>Just a reminder for our Scoutmaster Conference (SMC) and Board of Review (BOR), it is the SCOUTS’ responsibility to schedule these, NOT the parent. Our policies for both are as follows:A scout must first fulfill all requirements, including
                        all merit badges and all leadership position related requirements. As was discussed at our recent meeting, regarding leadership position-related requirements – completing the work outlined in your plan (along with any additions suggested)
                        – needs to be completed satisfactorily for leadership credit.</p>
                    <p>Once a scout has completed all of these requirements, he is to meet with his patrol’s Assistant Scoutmaster to have him review these requirements and sign off on all that are completed in the scout’s book.</p>
                    <p>Once all requirements are signed off in the book by the Assistant Scoutmaster, a scout can then request a Scoutmaster Conference. This should be scheduled 7 days in advance.After the Scoutmaster Conference is successfully completed, a
                        scout can request a Board of Review.</p>

                    <p>Boards of Review should also be requested at least 7 days in advance. Exceptions are possible, but rare and usually done when adult leaders have contributed to a delay.</p>
                    <p>Scoutmaster Conferences are scheduled directly with our Scoutmaster Mr. Garrick Chang. Your scout can contact him at the email form provided on the Contact Us page.</p>
                    <p>Boards of Review are to be scheduled with our Advancement Committee Chair. She can be contacted at the email form provided on the Contact Us page.</p>
                    <p>We continually need adult volunteers to perform BOR's so please let us know if you are able to help. Click <a href="http://www.scouting.org/Home/GuideToAdvancement/BoardsofReview.aspx">here</a> to see what a BOR is</p>
