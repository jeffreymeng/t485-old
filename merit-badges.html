                        Talk to Scoutmaster Mr. Chang about your interest in earning a merit badge. Read the requirements of
                        the merit badges you think might interest you. Choose one to earn. Mr. Chang will give you a signed
                        merit badge application (the “blue card”) and the name and contact information of a merit badge
                        counselor. These individuals have special knowledge in their merit badge subjects and are interested
                        in helping you.

                        Get in touch with the merit badge counselor and tell them that you want to earn the merit badge. The counselor may ask to meet you to explain what is
                        expected and to start helping you complete the requirements. You should also discuss work that you have already started or possibly completed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unless otherwise specified, work for a requirement can be started at any time. Ask your counselor to help you learn the things you need to know or do.
                        You should obtain and read the merit badge pamphlet on the subject.

                        The counselor will test you on each requirement to make sure you know your stuff and have done or can do the things required.</p>

                    <p>The current Boy Scout Requirements book is available from your local Scouting merchandise distributor. It may also be ordered online at www.scoutstuff.org. Merit badge requirements are revised as needed to reflect updated information and
                        technology. Click here to view new and recently revised merit badges.</p>
                    <p>You are expected to meet the requirements as they are stated—no more and no less. You must do exactly what is stated in the requirements. If it says "show or demonstrate," that is what you must do. Just telling about it isn’t enough. The
                        same thing holds true for such words as "make", "list", "in the field", and "collect", "identify", and "label."</p>
