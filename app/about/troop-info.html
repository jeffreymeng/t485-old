                        Mountain View, Palo Alto, San Jose, Santa Clara and Saratoga. The main thing that makes Troop 485 great is our variety outings and activities. In the past, we’ve done archery, had beach outings, backpacked in the Santa Cruz Mountains,
                        rafting on a river, slept in snow caves and many, many more fun things. During this past summer, we went to Camp Meriwether. Troop 485 has about 40 scouts and is located in Cupertino, California. It is with the Polaris District
                        in <a href="http://svmbc.org/svmbc">Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council</a>. Troop meetings are on Mondays from 7-8:30PM at the <a href="http://hoc5.org">Home of Christ Church</a> in Cupertino in the English Sanctuary.</p>

                        program for young people that builds character, trains them in the responsibilities of participating citizenship, and develops personal fitness.For over a century, the BSA has helped build the future leaders of this country by
                        combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun. The Boy Scouts of America believes — and, through over a century of experience, knows — that helping youth is a key to building a more conscientious, responsible, and
                        productive society.
