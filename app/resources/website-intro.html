                    <h3 class="text-center">The T485 Google Group/Email</h3>
                    <p>
                        Google groups is basically a mailing list for all of the members of a Google Group. Whenever anyone emails something to <b>t485<span class="email-at-symbol">[a  T]</span>googlegroups.com</b>, the email is forwarded to all members
                        of that Google Group. In gmail, Google Group emails are sorted in the Forums Tab(if you use <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/3094499?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en" target="_blank">tabs</a> in gmail to sort) There
                        is also an online service at groups.google.com in which you can view and search all the past emails sent to the T485 Google Group.

                        <br>
                        <br> To get started, just click <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/t485" target="_blank">here</a>, and request to join the T485 google group, then send me, Jeffrey Meng(
